My name is Kyle and this is my social site project. I will continiously update the site with changes and features to further test my skills as a developer. I am currently a student at Flat Iron School for software Engineering.
While I am attending school, I will also journal my progress in this README file. My notes will consist of things I have learned, mistakes, and also reflection of those mistakes and what I could have done better to the project. These updates will serve to make me a better developer as well as create a progressive story for any vistors to this repository.

 learned what the 'charset utf8' is used for. It is used in html to make sure that your site can display any chararacter in any human language within any browser without complications.
